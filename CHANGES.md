# Changes to Compound V2 Wallet Scoring Project

## Removed Notebooks for Data Exploration
- Deleted `notebooks/data_exploration.ipynb` and `notebooks/README.md`
- Removed the notebooks directory entirely
- Updated documentation to reflect this change

## Added Automatic Dataset Download
- Created a new script `src/data/download.py` that:
  - Downloads data from the provided Google Drive link
  - Identifies and uses the three largest files from the dataset
  - Falls back to synthetic data generation for testing when download fails
- Added `gdown` dependency to `requirements.txt` for Google Drive downloads
- Updated config to consistently use the three largest files

## Modified Data Loading Process
- Enhanced `get_largest_files` in helpers.py to support filtering by file extension
- Modified the DataLoader to work with any file format, with special handling for JSON
- Integrated download functionality into the main pipeline

## Streamlined the Pipeline
- Created a convenience shell script `run_pipeline.sh` that:
  - Sets up a virtual environment
  - Installs dependencies
  - Downloads the dataset
  - Runs the complete pipeline
- Updated the main.py to check for data and download it if necessary

## Enhanced Documentation
- Updated README.md with the new approach
- Updated PROJECT_CONTEXT.md with current implementation status
- Created this CHANGES.md document to track modifications

## Testing
- Added test_download.py to verify the download functionality
- Ensured the entire pipeline can run from scratch with no manual steps

These changes align with the project objectives of creating a robust, automated wallet scoring system for Compound V2, with a focus on processing the three largest JSON files from the dataset.
