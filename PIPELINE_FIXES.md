# Compound V2 Wallet Scoring Pipeline Fixes

This document outlines the fixes and improvements made to the wallet scoring pipeline to ensure its proper functioning.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Python Path Configuration

**Commit**: `Add Python path configuration to fix import issues`

- Added proper Python path configuration in main.py to ensure imports work correctly
- This resolved the 'No module named src' error that was occurring when running the pipeline

### 2. Anomaly Detection Enhancements

**Commit**: `Update anomaly detector to dynamically handle small datasets with adaptive PCA`

- Fixed PCA dimensionality reduction to dynamically adapt to small datasets
- Implemented a flexible approach that uses `min(10, n_samples-1, n_features)` for component count
- Added proper column naming to match wallet features data structure
- Improved error handling throughout the anomaly detection process

### 3. Heuristic Scoring Improvements

**Commit**: `Enhance heuristic scorer with credit score grading and improved output format`

- Added credit score grading system (A-F) based on numerical score ranges
- Improved score output format to include more relevant information
- Enhanced output file naming for better integration with the wallet scorer
- Fixed column name references to match the data structure

### 4. Wallet Scorer Robustness

**Commit**: `Update wallet scorer with improved analysis and robust error handling`

- Updated references to use the new file path for wallet scores
- Added logic to use pre-calculated credit scores directly if available
- Enhanced error handling with proper exception catching and logging
- Improved wallet analysis output with more comprehensive statistics
- Added feature correlation analysis to provide more insights

### 5. Test Run Data and Results

**Commit**: `Add generated data and results from test run`

- Added sample data generated during testing
- Included processed intermediate files
- Added model files (anomaly detector, scaler)
- Included results from test run for verification

## Overall Improvements

1. **Robustness**: The pipeline now handles edge cases like small datasets gracefully
2. **Consistency**: Column naming and file references are now consistent across modules
3. **Error Handling**: Better error messages and graceful failure handling
4. **Outputs**: Enhanced analysis output with more insights and readable formats
5. **Documentation**: Improved code comments and output documentation

## Running the Pipeline

The full pipeline can now be run with:

```bash
./run_pipeline.sh
```

Or specific stages can be executed using:

```bash
python3 src/main.py --skip-to [stage]
```

Where `[stage]` is one of: `load`, `preprocess`, `features`, `anomaly`, `heuristic`, or `score`.
